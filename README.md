# Availity-homework

1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  
    Me and a group of three ofher people were able to make fully formed web app in less then two weeks, in Django, complete with styling. The app was able to suggest a restaurant, that you and the person you were eating with shared.


2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)
    The most recent book that I have read was a reread of WeaveWorld from Clive Baeker, I have read this book 3 times so far. It's a wonderful story that blends elements of horror with high fantasy that's grounded in the real world. I would recommend this book alone on the fact that Clive Barker is one of the best horror writers to have ever graced us with the written word. 


3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
